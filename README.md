+ Install

  `compile 'zh.wang.android:yweathergetter4a:1.3.0'`

+ How to use ([Sample Activity](https://github.com/zh-wang/YWeatherGetter4a/blob/master/app/src/main/java/zh/wang/android/yweathergetter4a_demo/MainActivity.java))

   * Implement `YahooWeatherInfoListener` in your Activity. `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permissions are required.

        ```java
        @Override
        public void gotWeatherInfo(WeatherInfo weatherInfo, YahooWeather.ErrorType errorType) {
            if(weatherInfo != null) {
                // Add your code here
                // weatherInfo object contains all information returned by Yahoo Weather API
                // if `weatherInfo` is null, you can get the error from `errorType`
            }
        }
        ```

  * Get a instance of `YahooWeather` class.

        ```java
        YahooWeather mYahooWeather = YahooWeather.getInstance();
        ```

  * Query by place's name. You can replace `cityAreaOrLocation` to what you want. For example, "Tokyo Japan", "Acara√π Brazil", "Shanghai China", etc.

        ```java
        public void queryYahooWeatherByPlaceName(final Context context, final String cityAreaOrLocation, final YahooWeatherInfoListener result)
        ```

  * Query by latitude and longitude

        ```java
        public void queryYahooWeatherByLatLon(final Context context, final String lat, final String lon, final YahooWeatherInfoListener result)
        ```

  * Or use device's gps to detect current location. __`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` is required__.

        ```java
        public void queryYahooWeatherByGPS(final Context context, final YahooWeatherInfoListener result)
        ```

+ Other settings

  * You can set connect timeout and socket timeout by `setConnectTimeout` and `setSocketTimeout`. Or get the instance by `getInstance(int connectTimeout, int socketTimeout)`.

  * If you use GPS position for query, the result `WeatherInfo` will contains an `Address` object, which is the detail address object return from `Geocoder`. It contains a lot of information but this lib only use `locality`, `adminArea`, and `countryName` by default. See `YahooWeather.addressToPlaceName` and [Geocoder](http://developer.android.com/intl/ja/reference/android/location/Address.html) for details.

+ What kind of weather information can I get?
  You can get
  * current condition of weather, humidity, wind, etc.
  * forecast of next four days.
